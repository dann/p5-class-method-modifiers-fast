=head1 NAME

Class::Method::Modifiers::Fast - provides Moose-like method modifiers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Child;
    use parent 'Parent';
    use Class::Method::Modifiers::Fast;

    sub new_method { }

    before 'old_method' => sub {
        carp "old_method is deprecated, use new_method";
    };

    around 'other_method' => sub {
        my $orig = shift;
        my $ret = $orig->(@_);
        return $ret =~ /\d/ ? $ret : lc $ret;
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Method modifiers are a powerful feature from the CLOS (Common Lisp Object
System) world.

C<Class::Method::Modifiers::Fast> provides three modifiers: C<before>, C<around>, 
and C<after>. C<before> and C<after> are run just before and after the method they
modify, but can not really affect that original method. C<around> is run in
place of the original method, with a hook to easily call that original method.
See the C<MODIFIERS> section for more details on how the particular modifiers
work.

=head1 MODIFIERS

=head2 before method(s) => sub { ... }

C<before> is called before the method it is modifying. Its return value is
totally ignored. It receives the same C<@_> as the the method it is modifying
would have received. You can modify the C<@_> the original method will receive
by changing C<$_[0]> and friends (or by changing anything inside a reference).
This is a feature!

=head2 after method(s) => sub { ... }

C<after> is called after the method it is modifying. Its return value is
totally ignored. It receives the same C<@_> as the the method it is modifying
received, mostly. The original method can modify C<@_> (such as by changing
C<$_[0]> or references) and C<after> will see the modified version. If you
don't like this behavior, specify both a C<before> and C<after>, and copy the
C<@_> during C<before> for C<after> to use.

=head2 around method(s) => sub { ... }

C<around> is called instead of the method it is modifying. The method you're
overriding is passed in as the first argument (called C<$orig> by convention).
Watch out for contextual return values of C<$orig>.

You can use C<around> to:

=over 4

=item Pass C<$orig> a different C<@_>

    around 'method' => sub {
        my $orig = shift;
        my $self = shift;
        $orig->($self, reverse @_);
    };

=item Munge the return value of C<$orig>

    around 'method' => sub {
        my $orig = shift;
        ucfirst $orig->(@_);
    };

=item Avoid calling C<$orig> -- conditionally

    around 'method' => sub {
        my $orig = shift;
        return $orig->(@_) if time() % 2;
        return "no dice, captain";
    };
